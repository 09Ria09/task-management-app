# Week 2

## Formative assessment

- **Chair**: Alexandru Tabacaru
- **Notetaker**: Teun Bosch


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: All the agenda points were discussed in depth, with feedback and opinions from every team member.  
Good use of time indications. Those can be really useful for structuring the meeting especially in weeks that you have much to talk about.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chairman was really well-prepared. He encourages the team to communicate and makes sure constantly that things are good with the other members.  
He encourages all the other teammates to state their opinion and does not go to the next point unless everything previously discussed is clear for everyone.  
Good quick summary at the end and overview of future action points, so overall the meeting was guided really well.  
(I liked the idea where everyone stated one thing they like about a certain assignment they completed (example: Code of C.) and one thing they think can be improved.)  

#### Time management

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda topics were talked about in-depth. Clarifications were made along the way together with the team.  
It was really important for the chairman to stick to his 'schedule' because he had a lot prepared, but he managed to finish everything right on time.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Minute taker wrote down important points discussed during the meeting.      
Major decisions are present in the notes, as well as future deadlines and suggestions from me.    
(Tip: Write the notes directly on the laptop instead of on paper. It will be easier and faster to upload and have them later.)

#### Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The communication throughout the meeting went well. I did not have to intervene (only at the end when I was asked for help), everything was planned.  
The chairman involved everyone from the beginning and made sure to keep it that way throughout the whole meeting. Keep up with this!   
They were helping each other and trying to solve problems on the spot.   
Everyone was listened to and different opinions/ideas were taken into account for important decisions.  
All of them took initiative during different parts of the meeting, they were answering each other's questions and coming up with ideas fast.
