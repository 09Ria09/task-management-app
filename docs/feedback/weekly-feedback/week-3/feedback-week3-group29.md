#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda followed the template. The individual points were clear so the team was able to prepare before the meeting.  
Agenda added to the repository, but in the future try to stick to the time frame (of uploading agendas/notes) you agreed on as a team.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Minute taker wrote down important points discussed during the meeting.      
Major decisions are present in the notes, as well as future deadlines and suggestions from me.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair covered all the topics in the agenda for an appropiate amount of time. He was well-prepared and cautious with the time.
One thing that you can adopt in the future is the technique with the rotating way of talking, as well as a quick summary of future points of action, as some of your teammates suggested.


#### Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The meeting went well with people always sharing ideas, making agreements, checking and helping each other. Different comments/opinions were taken into account.
However, a few of you were kind of silent for most parts of the meeting, so please pay attention to this if you feel like you are in this situation and try to improve for the next meetings!
