# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 7: Rares  
Minute taker of week 7: Teun  
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Edsard

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was comprehensive and added to the repository on time. It followed the template and the individual points were clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Notes are clear and contain concrete agreements, decisions and suggestions.      
The agreements are actionable and realistic. Maybe try to also include a part where you state which tasks are assigned to which people for a better overview of the next steps.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Chair clearly led the meeting. He involved evryone in the conversation, made sure that ideas were taken into account and quickly came with proposals if team was unsure abour certain things.  
All topics from the agenda were covered and time management was great.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting.        
The overall atmosphere was constructive. Students were coming up with solutions for the problems and were discussing important topics in depth.  
Everyone was involved, listened to and ideas were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Demo had clear improvements from last weeks. You should finish the basic requirements as soon as possible (if they are not done yet).  
After that, try to implement as much as possible from the other epics, while keeping in mind the prioritization of the epics and the task division between team members.  
I think you are on the right track for having a working complete application until project end.
