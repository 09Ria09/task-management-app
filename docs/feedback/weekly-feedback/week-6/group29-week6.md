# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 6: Matej
Minute taker of week 6: Edsard   
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Dorian

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and the points were clear. Make sure to also upload the agend to the repository before the meeting.  
It was lacking some important topics that were brought up only during the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Notes are clear and contain concrete agreements, decisions and suggestions.      
The agreements are actionable and realistic. Maybe try to also include a summary of action points at the end.      
The part where you state which tasks are assigned to which people is a great addition for a better overview of the next steps.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair ensured that all topics from the agenda were covered. The flow of the meeting went well.  
The chair also made sure to always include everyone in the conversation and ask for everyone's opinion on the different topics that were discussed.  
The only remark would be to pay more attention to the time management so you don't end up way ahead of your schedule.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting.        
The overall atmosphere was constructive. Students were coming up with solutions for the problems and were discussing important topics in depth.  
Everyone was involved, listened to and ideas were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The team had the initiative to present the current state of their application.  
There was clear progress from last week.
By the end of this week you should have all basic requirements done and also start working on the next epics in order to make sure you stay on track.    
Make sure that you "level up" your contributions so that you all have (aprox) equal contributions.      
Pay attention to the people that didn't work enough so far for the product and try to divide the tasks accordingly.
