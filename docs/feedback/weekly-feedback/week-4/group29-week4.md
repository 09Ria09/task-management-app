# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair of week 4: Edsard Grisel  
Minute taker of week 4: Dorian Herbiet     
Minute taker of previous week (the one to whom the feedback is addressed): Alexandru Tabacaru

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time and it followed the template.  
The individual points were clear, but a bit more information regarding the main points can be added in the future (things like specific questions from the other teammembers, important decisions that you need to adress for each main topic and so on).
(Tip: Add a double whitespace at the end of each line to make the next sentence appear on a new line when writing in markdown :) )


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes are clear and follow the agenda topics.  
All the points discussed during the meeting were added to the notes. It contains concrete and realistic agreements.  
The amount of notes is good, but in the future be careful to not overdetail some sections. If the notes become unclear, then the teammates will tend to get lost in too much information.  
A good practice for example would be to highlight (bold) some important parts, especially in the "Next Course of Action" section (info concerning **who** and **when**).


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair made sure that each topic from the agenda was covered, but besides this he didn't intervene too much.  
As a chair, after introducing the topic that will be discussed next, you should also lead the conversation further, so you act as an example for the rest of the team when it is their turn to speak.  
You should also intervene if the team starts elaborating too much on a subject which may cause delays in your initially planned schedule.  
The closing of the meeting was also kinbd of absent. After discussing the feedback round, there were some other small topics discussed, but then in the end the teammates were a bit confused whether the meeting was done or not yet because of no closing of the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The flow of the meeting went well and the atmosphere was constructive.  
Different ideas/comments were taken into accound.  
However, please pay attention to the people that seem to defocuss or not pay attention during the meeting. Everyone should be aware of what is discussed at each point. Not having anything to add for any of the discussed topics is a clear sign of not paying attention.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The team did present the current state of the application, but because things were not merged to main yet, there wasn't much to show. Small improvements were made on both the client and the server side.
Regardless, I think that the team is on a good track to create a working application until the end of the project.
